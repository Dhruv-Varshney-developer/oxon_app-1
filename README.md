# Using reusable objects:

- To use oxonGreen color- color:AppTheme.colors.oxonGree
- To create the standard rounded button- style: SolidRoundButtonStyle()
- To style text- style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline2
- T0 style text with different color- style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline2!.copyWith(color: AppTheme.colors.oxonGreen)

# Points to note:

- Every Scaffold should have its backgroundColor property set to AppTheme.colors.oxonGreen
- Make responsive UI using height: (MediaQuery.of(context).size.height) * <percent value of the screen to be occupied> like code. For e.g., height: (MediaQuery.of(context).size.height) * 0.4
- When using CustomAppBar, you don't need any action buttons on the left side of the title simply call CustomAppBar(context, <title>)
If you do need action buttons, call CustomAppBar(context, <title>, <list of widgets that will be rendered as action buttons>)
  
- Keep in mind that the screen resolution of user's phone could be different from that of your emulator. So, design accordingly.
- Extract and refactor codes which are reusable and keep it in separate file. And also document how to use it.


# Creating responsive UI:

- Whenever possible, use the textTheme of the custom AppTheme as it is already made responsive.
  Use it in this way-
  ```Text(
        "Guide The Way",
        style: Theme.of(context)
            .textTheme
            .headline3!
            .copyWith(color: AppTheme.colors.oxonGreen),
                    )```
- Update the project. Then run the app in your usual emulator.
- Note the output value of print("responsiveMultiplier value = $responsiveMultiplier"); 
  (called in size_config) code from the logcat
- Using this multiplier value, transform every value which is responsible for a responsive UI 
  (for e.g., size of images, button, text, etc.)
- Python code for transformation is:
  ```
  def calc(currentValue, responsiveMultiplier):
    newValue = currentValue / responsiveMultiplier
    print('%.2f' % (newValue))
  
  ```
- Use the newValue value to replace your values in this way:
    Suppose my margin value is this-
  ```
  margin: EdgeInsets.only(top: 80.0)
  ```
  And in my case, the result value is 11.71 (= 80 / responsiveMultiplier).
  Then I would replace 80 with '11.71 * SizeConfig.responsiveMultiplier', as shown below-
  
  ```
  margin: EdgeInsets.only(top: 11.71 * SizeConfig.responsiveMultiplier)
  ```
